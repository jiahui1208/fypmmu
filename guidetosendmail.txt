To access to php.ini and sendmail.ini :

1. Go to your Xampp Folder [Xampp Installation Directory]
2. Open the PHP folder
3. Scroll down and find php.ini [type = configuration settings]
4. It will pop up a notepad
5. Scroll down and find mail function
6. Paste the below codes below the mail function, do not change or delete any codes that are previously provided, just add in the new codes


[mail function]

; For Win32 only.
; http://php.net/smtp
; SMTP=smtp.gmail.com
; http://php.net/smtp-port
; smtp_port=587
; sendmail_from = jyquek32@gmail.com
; sendmail_path = "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"

(*Please change the sendmail_from email to your own email address)

7. Then close the php.ini files, and then go back to the Xampp Folder and find send mail folder
8. Open the send mail folder and search for sendmail.ini [types = configuration settings]
9. It will pop up a notepad again
10. Paste the below codes below the sendmail, do not change or delete any codes that are previously provided, just add in the new codes

[sendmail]

; you must change mail.mydomain.com to your smtp server,
; or to IIS's "pickup" directory.  (generally C:\Inetpub\mailroot\Pickup)
; emails delivered via IIS's pickup directory cause sendmail to
; run quicker, but you won't get error messages back to the calling
; application.

; smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
; smtp_port=587
; error_logfile=error.log
; debug_logfile=debug.log
; auth_username=your_email_address_here
; auth_password=your_password_here
; force_sender=your_email_address_here (it's optional)

Next,

Create a php file and name it send-mail.php

Paste the following codes to this php file :

<?php
$receiver = "receiver email address here";
$subject = "Email Test via PHP using Localhost";
$body = "Hi, there...This is a test email send from Localhost.";
$sender = "From:sender email address here";

if(mail($receiver, $subject, $body, $sender)){
    echo "Email sent successfully to $receiver";
}else{
    echo "Sorry, failed while sending mail!";
}

Woohoo! Your done!
